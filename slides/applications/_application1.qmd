:::{.incremental}
1. In `JupyterLab`, open the notebook located at `formation-mlops/notebooks/mlflow-introduction.ipynb`
2. Choose our custom `Python` kernel : 
    + `Select Kernel -> Python environments... -> base (Python 3.x.x)`
3. Execute the notebook cell by cell. If you are finished early, explore the `MLflow` UI and try to build your own experiments from the example code provided in the notebook.
