## Deploying a machine-learning model as an API

1. We constructed a very simplistic Rest API using FastAPI. All underlying files are in the `app` folder. Check it.
2. Open the `Dockerfile` to see how the image is built. The image is publish via Github Actions, if interested have a look to `.github/workflows/build_image.yml`.
3. Open the file `kubernetes/deployment.yml` and modify the highlighted lines accordingly:

```{yml code-line-numbers: "7"}
containers:
- name: api
    image: inseefrlab/formation-mlops-api:main
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    env:
    - name: MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI
        value: https://projet-formation-******.user.lab.sspcloud.fr
    - name: MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME
        value: fasttext-model
    - name: MLFLOW_MODEL_VERSION
        value: "1"
```

4. On the [SSP Cloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/home), launch an Argo-cd service by clicking [this URL](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/automation/argo-cd?autoLaunch=true)
5. Create a new application and use the yaml template stored in the `argocd` folder
    a. `Create an application  -> Edit as YAML` 
    b. Adjust the yaml to your purpose
    c. `Save -> Create`
6. Reach your API using the URL you defined in your `ingress.yml` file
7. Display the documentation of your API by adding `/docs` to your URL
8. Try your API out!
9. Re-run a new model and deploy this new model in your API

1. Run a model
2. Register the model
3. Adjust your MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME or MLFLOW_MODEL_VERSION environment variable in the `deployment.yml` file
4. Commit and push these changes
5. Synchronise in Argo-cd or wait for 5 minutes
6. Refresh your API, it should be based on your new version!
