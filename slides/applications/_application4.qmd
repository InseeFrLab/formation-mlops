## Part 1 : introduction to `Argo Workflows`

:::{.incremental}
1. Open an `Argo Workflows` service on the `SSP Cloud`
2. In `VSCode`, create a `hello_world.yaml` file and copy into it the content from the [Hello world](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/master/examples/hello-world.yaml) example workflow
3. Submit the `Hello world` workflow via a terminal in `VSCode` : 
    + `argo submit hello_world.yaml`
4. Open the UI of `Argo Workflows`. Find the logs of the workflow you just launched.

## Part 2 : distributing the hyperparameters optimization

:::{.incremental}
1. Take a look at the `argo_workflows/workflow.yml` file. What do you expect will happen when we submit this workflow ?
2. Submit the workflow and look at the jobs completing live in the UI. 
3. Once all jobs are completed, visualize the logs of the whole workflow. 
4. Finally, open the `MLflow` UI to check what has been done.
