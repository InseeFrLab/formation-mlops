## Distributing the hyperparameter optimization with an orchestrator

:::{.incremental}
1. Open an `Argo Workflows` service on the `SSP Cloud`
2. In `VSCode`, create a `hello_world.yaml` file and copy into it the content from the [Hello world](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/master/examples/hello-world.yaml) example workflow
3. Submit the `Hello world` workflow via a terminal in `VSCode` : 
    + `argo submit hello_world.yaml`
2. Take a look at the `argo_workflows/workflow.yml` file. What do you expect will happen when we submit this workflow ?
3. Submit the workflow. Once all jobs are completed, visualize the logs. Then open the MLflow UI to check what has been done.
